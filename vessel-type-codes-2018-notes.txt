The first column are the gross vessel groups. They are all text. Some contain
spaces, and one contains a slash (/) character.

The second column is the vessel type, a continuous integer starting at zero (0)
and carrying through to 1025 with the exception that there is no one thousand (1000)
in the list. 

The third column is the "AIS Vessel Code" and is the same as the Vessel Type number
through 999. From 999 on, the value is null.

Row 1000 (or that row that would have been 1000) is essentially a null/other catch-all.

The fourth column is the "AIS Ship & Cargo Classification" through 999, where it changes
to "AVIS Vessel Service" which doesn't look any different in character to the AIS 
Ship and Cargo Classification values. 

But, this makes it essentially two tables split after row 999.
